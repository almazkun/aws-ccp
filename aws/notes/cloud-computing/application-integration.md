## Application Integration

### Simple Notification Service
Allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a "push" mechanism, eliminating the need to periodically check or "poll" for updates. 

Uses: event notification, monitoring applications, workflow systems, time-sensitive information updates, mobile applications, and any other application that generates or consumes notifications.

### Simple Queue Service
SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components.
